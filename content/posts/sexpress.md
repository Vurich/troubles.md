As you can probably tell if you've read anything else on this blog, I'm quite into low-level optimisation work. I'd probably say that right now it's my main programming interest. As a result, I've got quite a few projects on the go both during and outside work hours that focus specifically on efficiency. One of these is [sexpress][sexpress], a parser for [s-expressions][sexpressions] that as far as I can tell is the fastest in the world. On my laptop it can parse around 190 megabytes per second. That's not
